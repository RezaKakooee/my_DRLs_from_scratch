# Implementing DRL algorithms in Python from scratch

In this repository, my goal is to implement Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms in Python from scratch. 

These codes are proper to be used for educational purposes. So, RL practitioners might use other RL libraries such as RLlib, StabelBaselins, TF-Agent, etc. 

For writing these codes, I use different resources that will be added to the repo later. 

Please feel free to use the codes, and let me know if you see any bugs or mistakes.
